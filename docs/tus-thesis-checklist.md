- [ ] 1.5 Line Spacing
- [ ] Paragraphs Spacing 0 pt before, 8 pt after
- [ ] Text should be set to fully justified in the Normal Style

### Headings

- [ ] Recommend default spacing for your headings.
- [ ] Heading 1 starts on a new page
- [ ] Headings Bold, multi-level list
- [ ] Appendices should have their own Heading numbering (start at 1) and be numbered separately from each other.

### Pages

- [ ] Margins 4cm left, 2cm right, 2.5cm top, 2.5cm bottom
- [ ] Page numbers should be inserted in the footer of the page and aligned to the right
- [ ] You are required to use Roman Numerals for all of the pages before the Introduction
  - [ ] Text for anything other than Body text should be left-aligned, including headings, table contents, and Reference lists.
- [ ] Figures should always appear after the end of the paragraph in which they are first referenced, or as close as possible to that point to avoid having gaps between areas of text.
- [ ] Do not interrupt a paragraph or a sentence to insert a figure or table.
- [ ] Do not precede figures and tables with Chapter numbers (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, etc.). Figures should begin with Figure 1 and tables with Table 1.
- [ ] A List of Figures and a List of Tables must be inserted in your document just after the Tables of Contents (see Section 5).

### The Binder Cover

- [ ]  The title appears at the top in at least 24pt font
- [ ]  Your full name (first name and surname) appears under this, also centred. This will be in a smaller point
- [ ]  The award appears underneath this (e.g., BSc. (Honours) in Computer Networks and Systems Management). The year of submission appears underneath this (e.g., 2019). You may place the TUS logo on the cover page if you wish, but you must use a high-quality version if you do.
- [ ]  The spine of the document must also include some information so that it can be identifiable on a library shelf. You need to include your name, the year, and the award, which can be abbreviated if it is too long to fit (e.g., BSc (Hons) SD).
- [ ]  The font used for the cover page should be selected to look good. The font used in the sample cover page is Georgia.

## Printing

- [ ] The document should be printed on one side of the paper only.
