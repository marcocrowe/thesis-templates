# Acknowledgements

"Charles Xavier did more for mutants than you will ever know. My single
greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live." - Eric
Lensherr, 2006

I would like to thank my supervisor Henry McCoy for helping me to
complete my research. In additional I would like to thank my parents
Christopher and Katherine and my friends Jean, Logan, and Warren for all
their support during my time in university.

# Abstract

This is a sample thesis layout with AI and Software development headings
to guide you in developing your thesis. It contains styles, formatting,
and a suggested structure with features like headers, footers,
page-numbers, Table of contents, Table of figures and managed
references.

It is a useful and common practice to put the abstract in Times New
Roman 12-point italics. Throughout this document the styles used reflect
the styles we suggest you use in your scientific report.
